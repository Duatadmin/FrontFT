HOW TO USE THIS STRUCTURE
Home is the new default route ‚Äì keeps users oriented and funnels them to action.

Coach handles real-time workout flow; on session completion it POSTs to workout_sessions and triggers toast linking to Diary.

Programs owns CRUD of plans / goals; other modules treat it as single source of truth.

Training Diary remains the detailed log but now shares components (SessionDrawer) with Coach to avoid duplication.

Progress only reads aggregated data ‚Äì no direct editing.

Nutrition is optional: can be disabled in features flags without breaking nav.

Settings sits last, separated visually to reduce accidental taps.

This hierarchy is scannable, groups tasks by mental model (Do ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Review), and leaves room for future modules (e.g., Community) without re-ordering core items.
