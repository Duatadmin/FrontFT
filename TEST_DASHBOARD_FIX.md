# Dashboard Layout Switching Fix Test

## What was fixed:
1. **useDashboardData hook** - Added proper request cancellation and cleanup
   - Added AbortController to cancel in-flight requests
   - Added fetchInProgressRef to prevent concurrent fetches
   - Added proper cleanup on component unmount
   - Fixed useEffect dependencies

2. **ResponsiveDashboard** - Changed to single component pattern
   - Now uses the same EnhancedDashboard component for both mobile and desktop
   - Just wraps it in different layouts (MobileDashboardLayout vs AnalyticsDashboardLayout)
   - Prevents component unmount/remount on layout changes

3. **EnhancedDashboard** - Removed embedded layout
   - Removed the hardcoded AnalyticsDashboardLayout wrapper
   - Now relies on parent component for layout

## How to test:
1. Open the app at http://localhost:5174/
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Navigate to the Dashboard
4. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
5. Toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M) to switch between mobile and desktop views
6. Switch back and forth multiple times

## Expected behavior:
- Dashboard data should remain loaded when switching layouts
- No "continuous loading" state
- Console should show "Cancelling previous request" messages
- Data should not disappear or get stuck

## Console logs to look for:
- `[useDashboardData] Cancelling previous request` - Good, means cleanup is working
- `[useDashboardData] Request aborted` - Good, means abort is working
- `[useDashboardData] Fetch already in progress, skipping...` - Good, prevents duplicates

## If issues persist:
Check for these potential problems:
1. Multiple SubscriptionGate instances still firing
2. Other components causing re-renders
3. Auth state changes during layout switch
